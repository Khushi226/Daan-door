Urban India has already reached the 21st century, but the same cannot be said of the people living in our villages. To get the villagers to the 21st century too, development, education, medical facilities are needed. Bhartiya Vikas Sansthan, is one such pioneer organisation working in various fields in towns and villages. We work on different projects in the field of Education, Healthcare, Youth, Environment Differently-abled, Women Empowerment and Employment opportunities offered through our organisation with our other network partners. We also work to spread awareness about various social issues with the support of our volunteers.

Established as the not- for- profit organization in the year 2009, Anahita Foundation operates with the single-minded focus of empowering rural India. Our vision is rural empowerment through best practices, modern technology and values.

Our philosophy states that India lives in her villages and we cannot rise to our true potential as a country without a fundamental transformation in the lives of people in rural India. At the Anahita Foundation we believe that the partnership of rural India with corporate, young urban India, the Government and other foundations is the key to create a permanent and irreversible change for good.

Ever since its inception, the foundation has been working to positively impact unserved and underserved communities and contribute towards national and international development goals. The organization works closely with all the stakeholders' in order to bring about sustainable changes in the lives of the underprivileged and last miles communities.
